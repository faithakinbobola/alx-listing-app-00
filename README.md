# ALX Listing App

## 🏡 About the Project

The **ALX Listing App** is a modern Airbnb clone scaffold built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **ESLint**. This milestone focuses on laying a solid foundation for a scalable and maintainable property listing page.

The goal is to establish best practices in frontend development while building reusable components and a clean folder structure that supports growth and real-world use cases.
